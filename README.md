# CodeProjects
These are projects that I have worked on in class as part of my education.

#Object Oriented
The focus of this class was to learn Javan language and understand how to utilize objects and single responsibility principles.
The project we created was a Bank account managing program that would let a user choose a person and deposite or withdraw funds into the account.

#StackAssign
The focus of this project was to learn how the data structure of Stacks worked.
The program checks for unpaired brakets and curly braces in a text document.
